Before we take part in the regression algorithms, there is one more thing need to be clear.  
The **core** of the machine learning, is to find one equation  `y = f(x)`   
Just find one f then we solve the problem.  

# Linear Regression
The simplest example of f(x) is `y = mx + c`. It is the form of linear equations.  
In linear regression, we need to find a **best-fit** linear equation.  
Use the figures below, we may insert a line to fit the points inside.(left to right)

What is the meaning of **best-fit** ？
**Answer:**  The predicted values will be as close as possible to 'reality'.  
De-abstraction, measure distance between predicted values and real values, which refers to a terminology 👉🏻 **residual**  
$$residual = |y - \hat{y}| = y - (mx + c)$$
