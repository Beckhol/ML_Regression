Before we take part in the regression algorithms, there is one more thing need to be clear.  
The **core** of the machine learning, is one equation  `y = f(x)`   
Just find one f then we solve the problem.  

# Linear Regression
The simplest example of f(x) is `y = mx + c`. It is the form of linear equations.  
In linear regression, we need to find a **best-fit** linear equation.  
Use the figures below, we may insert a line to fit the points inside.(left to right)
