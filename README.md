# What is machine learning ?
Machine learning have applied to many areas nowadays. Normally, the goal of most machine learning algorithms is to construct a model, to estimate Y(Outcome) based on X(Features).

# What will be covered in the notes ?
In this documents, we will first focus on the regression parts in machine learning from basic ones to deeper ones.
* Linear Regression 🍎
* Polynomial Regression 🍌
* Ridge Regression 🍊
* Lasso Regression 🍉
* ElasticNet Regression 🍓

But how do we know the model is good or bad ❓ Then we need to use some metrics to evaluate the model.
* Plot
* MAE(Mean absolute error)
* RMSE(Root Mean Squared error)
* MSE(Mean squared error)
* MAE(Median absolute error)
* R-squared
